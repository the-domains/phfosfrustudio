Welcome to Phfosfrustudio, an art studio in Portland, Oregon. I'm Kristin, the artist and founder of Phosfrus. I specialize in hand-drawn / digitally enhanced illustrations made to illuminate the spaces where you live, carry a torch for your words or sketches, adorn your body with colors and patterns. 

Phosfrus artwork is offered in three categories:   
1: TEXTILES  -  2: PRODUCTS & REPRINTS  -  3: ORIGINALS 

TEXTILES  
I focus on the textile industry my patterns are released in accordance to the Northern Hemisphere seasons with a lead time of six months. For example, Fall illustrations first become available at the end of July and are discontinued at the start of December for Winter.
